# Babies First Pentest: NMAP Scanning from Remote Server

**Project Objectives**

The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the following skills:
* Spinning up a remote Linux server from a Cloud provider
* Installing NMAP
* Using NMAP to perform a basic TCP scan for open ports
* Taking the data and hardening my network

## Setting up a Linux Cloud Server
For this portion of the project, we will be utilizing [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/)'s Cloud Services.

### Creating a Droplet
1. Click the green "Create" button at the top and sleect "Droplets" from the menu
2. Create Droplet (Assume defaults if not addressed)
   - Choose Region: Select a location that is at least in the same country as yourself
   - Datacenter: Doesn't matter unless the cheapest option isn't available
   - Choose an image: Choose Debian (or whatever flavor you're comfy withP)
   - Choose Size: Basic
   - CPU Options: Regular - $4.00/mo ($0.006/hr) 512MB Ram, 1 CPU, 10GB SSD, 500GB Transfer
   - Choose Authentication Method: Choose password
   - Finalize Details: Hostname: Give it a better name (or leave it alone)
   - Click "Create Droplet"

## Accessing Droplet and Installing NMAP

### Accessing your Droplet
1. Click the "..." menu next to your newly created Droplet
2. Click "Access console"
3. Click "Launch Droplet Console"

### Installing NMAP
1. Issue command in your droplet ```apt install nmap```

## Using NMAP for basic TCP scanning
Scanning the network is very easy to do, and if you want to know about other flags, check out this awesome resource [NMAP Cheat Sheet](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/)

### Running NMAP scan
1. Take note of your WAN IP Address
   - Google ```what is my ip``` if you need to
2. Issue command in your droplet ```nmap -sT 161.0.0.0```
   - For security purposes, my example uses a fake WAN IP
   - -sT flag is for scanning open TCP ports that can be accessed from the WAN

### Reviewing the Results
The results are in! According to this basic NMAP scan of 1000 ports, only port 25 is "kind-of" opened, but filtered. Filtered mean that there is likely a firewall present that doesn't allow for NMAP to properly connect to it from the WAN, but it's opened to applications (or access controlled list) of IPs that need it.
```
root@babies-first-pentest:~# nmap -sT 161.0.0.0.0
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-11 19:41 UTC
Nmap scan report for 161-0-0-0-0.ISPNAME.com (161.0.0.0)
Host is up (0.064s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT    STATE     SERVICE
25/tcp  filtered  smtp

Nmap done: 1IP address (1host up) scanned in 2.18 seconds
```

### A note about Cloud service providers
It's IMPORTANT when playing with these servers that you remember to turn them off after they are done. You are only charaged for the time you used running the container (Droplet). If you only used the server long enough to issue a command and review the results, it cost you less than $0.01.

**Two Methods in Digital Ocean**

Console
1. Issue command in your doroplet ```poweroff```

Web
1. Click the green "ON" toggle to "OFF"
